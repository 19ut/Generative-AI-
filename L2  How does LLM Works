LLM can't calculate the things, it can just predict 
mostly , it can't calculate even 2+2 it's all about prediction, it can't ever run the code
 for ex- for 2+2, gpt has saw it multiple times so It can predict but I asked this
question "22323232323 √ó 2323232323232567876"
 gpt denied to answer this question, need a proff, okay !, here is the proff sirrrr

            Qn:- without any external help
              calculate 22323232323*2323232323232567876
              ChatGPT said:
              üòÖ As a pure LLM, I can‚Äôt actually calculate that.
              Why?
              Because I don‚Äôt have a real ‚Äúmath engine‚Äù inside me ‚Äî I‚Äôm just predicting likely text. 
              For huge numbers like:
              22323232323 √ó 2323232323232567876
              there‚Äôs no way I can predict the exact result reliably. I might give you a 
             plausible-looking big number, but it could be completely wrong.
              This is exactly where my LLM limits show:
              I don‚Äôt do actual step-by-step multiplication.
              I only learned patterns of how such numbers look in text.            
              ‚úÖ TL;DR: I can‚Äôt calculate this.
              ‚úÖ I can only guess ‚Äî and I‚Äôd probably guess wrong.

Hope uh get your answer, so I'm again saying it is all about prediction + pattern recognization.
So, now the question is , from where chatgpt will give the answer the answer is "External Help"
so, what will he do, he will write the code of python of the given problem and then it'll go to 
any external compiler ( which is given to him/her, idk it's male or female ohhh sorry, it an AI, okayyy) 
and then external compiler will compile 
the whole code and then it'll give the answer
to gpt and then gpt will give the answer to us.

okaayyyy, next part, LLM usually don't predict your last answers but what it'll do is it'll go to all 
previous questions and as well as answers which is given by him only and then it remembers your everything 
we think he remembers our's everything but deep down he is predicting the answers by just checking 
his previous response...
